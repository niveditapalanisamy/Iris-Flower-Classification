Its a Machine learning Project based on Iris Flowers Classification were you can predict the Iris species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width as input.
The Iris Flower species are setosa, versicolor, verginica. Where the predictions would be 0,1,2.

In this project, we will be working on Iris dataset to classify the flowers species, we will follow the whole machine learning project lifecycle and also we will deploy it using flask. Below is the whole outline that we will be following.

 *  Loading the imporatant libraries
 * Loading and understanding the Iris data
 * Exploring the data
 * Visualizaing the data
  * Checking if our data is skewed or not using countplot.
  * We will plot the grids for every species.
* Checking Null Values
* Dividing the data
* Model Development
    * Using Lr, SVM, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting
    * Calculating loss
    * Training on every algorithm
    * Choosing the best
* Saving the Model


The deployment of the project is given below: \
